# Nuxt MCP Server

There is an MCP server available for Nuxt that provides tools to querying project structure and documentation.

## Component Discovery

When working with Nuxt components, you can use the MCP server to find component locations.
Components often use nested naming syntax. For example, `<HomeIntro />` corresponds to `app/components/home/Intro.vue`.
You can query the file structure or use MCP tools to find these if available.

## Key Features

- **Component Mapping**: Resolves component names to file paths.
- **Documentation**: Access to Nuxt documentation.

## Usage

Use the available MCP tools to inspect the Nuxt project structure when unsure about component locations.
