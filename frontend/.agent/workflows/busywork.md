# Busywork

1. Analize centralized tasks below and TODOs outlined in the codebase.
1. Pick any you'd like to work on, create a new jj commit with a description and resolve it.
1. Remove any resolved TODOs.
1. Continue this loop.

## Centralized tasks

- I don't like the current gray in toolbars or the entry page /entity/[destionation]/[id]. Use green, which is a primary color - "#a8c79f"
- Remove any typing exception for eslint. Remove any any leftovers.
- Cypress tests are duplicated. Decide if they should be merged.
- Organize percySnapshots
  - Add percySnapshot in cypress tests to increase the coverage
  - also decrease their total number so we don't run out of quota.
- Component unification
  - Enter plan mode.
  - Analyze components and outline what they're used for.
  - Propose unification for some of them
- If discussion tab is open on /entity/[destionation]/[id] page, it should be a part of the URL
- Leads comments should be likeable - same voting methodology as voting on nodes or edges.
